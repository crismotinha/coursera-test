<h2>Siamese</h2>
<p>The Siamese cat is one of the first distinctly recognized breeds of Asian cat. Derived from the rtgs: wichianmat
 landrace, one of several varieties of cat native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the Siamese became one of 
 the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 20th century. The carefully refined modern Siamese 
 is characterized by blue almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, an elongated, slender, and 
 muscular body, and point colouration.

<h2>Sphynx</h2>
<p>The Sphynx is a breed of cat developed through selective breeding starting in the 1960s, known for its lack 
of a coat (fur), though it is not truly hairless. The skin should have the texture of chamois, as it has fine hairs.
 Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. The skin is the color their fur would be,
 and all the usual cat marking patterns (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, e) may be found on Sphynx skin. They lose
 body heat than coated cats.

<h2>Snowshoe</h2>
<p>The Snowshoe is a rare breed of cat originating in the United States of America in the 1960s. Snowshoes were first
 produced in Philadelphia when a Siamese breeder's cat gave birth to three kittens with white feet. The breeder, Dorothy
 Hinds-Daugherty, then began a breeding program to produce what were originally called "Silver Laces",[1] crossing the 
 strangely marked Siamese cats with bi-color American Shorthair cats and other breeds.
